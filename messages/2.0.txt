# Warning, breaking change!

After a long discussion in https://github.com/farcaller/DashDoc/issues/29
I came to decision to change the default hotkeys (ctrl+h and ctrl+alt+h).
Given there are no good alternatives, this version REMOVES the default hotkey,
leaving the choice to the user.

You can always use the command palette too.

To set up the hotkey for dash open the Preferences > Key Bindings from the menu
and add a new entry that looks like this:

    { "keys": ["YOUR HOTKEY"], "command": "dash_doc"}

for the default mode

    { "keys": ["YOUR HOTKEY"], "command": "dash_doc",
                               "args": { "flip_syntax_sensitive": true } }

for the flipped case sensitive mode.
